# GitMove™ – Authorship and Commit History

This repository reflects the official GitMove CLI project and contains the original public commits authored by Mike Hans (@marthurhans) beginning in May 2025.

## Commit Lineage

- The first commits were made in the [`marthurhans/gitmove`](https://github.com/marthurhans/gitmove) repo.
- This repo (`gitmove-cli/gitmove-cli`) is the canonical CLI home, and was backfilled with the original commit history.
- Development of core CLI logic is ongoing in a private staging repo and will be merged here after hardening and review.
