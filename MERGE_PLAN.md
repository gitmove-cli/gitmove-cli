# GitMove™ – Merge Plan

This repository ([`gitmove-cli/gitmove-cli`](https://github.com/gitmove-cli/gitmove-cli)) is the official home of the **GitMove CLI** project and the public source of truth for its ongoing development.

---

## 📍 Current Development Status

- This repo currently contains:
  - The original commit history migrated from [`marthurhans/gitmove`](https://github.com/marthurhans/gitmove) *(est. May 2025)*
  - GitMove’s official branding, licensing, and legal authorship declarations
- The **core CLI logic is under active development** in a private workspace and will be merged here following final testing, internal audit, and refactor stability.
- No functional code has been published yet to preserve GitMove’s authorship, protect its launch integrity, and avoid confusion during early structural changes.
